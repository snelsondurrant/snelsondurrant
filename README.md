#### Hi, I'm Nelson Durrant 👋
I'm currently studying Computer Engineering and Computer Science at Brigham Young University. I have the most experience with Python, C++, and Bash, but am familiar with Java, Javascript, and HTML/CSS. I enjoy reading (my favorites are books by Tolstoy or Dostoevsky), playing tennis, and robotics. I'm especially interested in BCI engineering and medical robotics.
